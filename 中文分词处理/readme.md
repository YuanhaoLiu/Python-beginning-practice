# Chinese text segmentation and some basic language process

It can be applied in very simple text analysis. Some part of the beginning practice.

* Added some new words into userdict and stopwords.txt by myself based on the corpus(which is clumsy)

* Combined with Gensim and visualized using pyLDAvis

* Used jieba

* Used yellowbrick
