From 0-1 Mission-led practice

# Something to say before start

从本科到现在浑浑噩噩几年，方向混乱没有章法，技能单一且低效，懒散却又不愿努力

选一个目前看起来自己能短时间掌握很多东西的技能

虽然不擅长，但也要开始学习这些东西 这个是用来放一些现阶段需要用到的
希望能够记录一下学习的过程 给2019年收个好的尾

因为也不是很熟悉基础知识，所以也会穿插一些统计知识之类的

## Aug 25-Sep 19 (Checked on Sep 19)
Plan: networkx, matplotlib visualization (how to plot)   

      how to map relationship and network (初步）-- not finished, did it with ucinet and gephi

      Sort paper and read how to write article   -- learned some basics
      
      统计学 Chapter 1-4   -- not finished, do it on night Sep 19.

## Sep 19-Sep 24 web crawl basics

Plan: how to get pass offical government websites, get, read and save the data  

      draw a worldmap

## October 2--

Still Web Scraping TT...

## --Oct 14, Oct15-22

Went through the courses by Mr.Han and gained some thoughts on python and ML. (mostly completed)

+ Web scraping and nlp on policy, and the stuffs conducted past weeks. Learn more on modeling and algorithms. (having difficulty)

+ Look for cases and think about the application forms, think clearly about what data and what areas I may be in the future. (not yet)

+ Be more specific and clear about the things I am doing 

+ Find a day and write the manuscript, sent the draft to supervisor

## Oct 22-Oct 30

+ Think more about algorithms, and networkx something

+ About spark, big data.

+ Write down the methods, results, build up a framework before Oct.27

------Edited on Oct.29---------

Starting paper, painful in writing the methods, wonder to what extent should i elaborate the analysis (started)

+ two major failures:

Tried yellowbrick, falied in doing the dispersion plot, dont know why. (completed) 

Tried to compute the perplexity using that by scikit-learn, failed in installing malley, dont know why. (used coherence to replace it)

+ So the research structure becomes simpler: jieba + gensim + tf-idf + LDA (completed)

Keep writing 500+ for each day, fighting~~

## Nov 7-11

--------Edited on Nov.7----------

The past week is tough, many things happened, keep apologizing and really have hard time telling whether people are telling the truths.

Good thing is that I finished my visa applicaion and started writing, phew!

I have already drated the intro, data, methods of my paper, but I found the data i use had a little problem and needed revision.

+ Revise data, find out more about DTM and how to plot, finish the results and send them to Prof before next Monday.

+ Read that book on Hong Kong by Gu Rude, very interesting, or maybe I should read some related to the housing problems

+ Sort out the knowledge map in this area, figure out what i should do after this paper

+ Learn about visualization, art and science

+ Learn the courses on DataCamp and finished that one in Coursera (Oops, my money, TT)

## Nov 12-16 

+ There will be some digital/technology events in Shenzhen, will go there.
